# Foucauldian Problematization

Ask not what something is, but how it became a "problem." Question how issues come to require attention, intervention, or management.

---

## Overview

Problematization is Foucault's term for the process by which something becomes an object of concern requiring thought, governance, or intervention. This skill does not ask "What is the solution?" but "How did this become a problem in the first place?" It reveals that what seems to demand attention is itself a historical construction.

**Core Principle:** "The work of thought is not to denounce the evil that would inhabit everything that exists, but to sense the danger that threatens in everything that is habitual."

---

## When to Use

- When something is presented as obviously requiring intervention
- When a debate takes for granted what the problem is
- When asking "What's the solution?" before asking "Why is this a problem?"
- When policy or reform is proposed
- When an issue seems to have always existed
- When examining moral panics or sudden concerns

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| issue | Yes | The "problem" to examine |
| context | No | Institutional or historical context |
| current_framing | No | How the problem is currently understood |
| proposed_solutions | No | What interventions are suggested |

---

## The Problematization Method

### Step 1: Identify the Problem-as-Given

State how the issue is currently framed as a problem requiring attention.

**Questions:**
- What is the problem said to be?
- What makes it a problem?
- Who says it's a problem?
- What about it demands intervention?

**Example:** "'Teen mental health' is framed as a crisis requiring intervention—rising rates of anxiety and depression, especially among girls, attributed to social media and academic pressure."

### Step 2: Ask: Was It Always a Problem?

Question whether this was always seen as a problem. When did it become one?

**Questions:**
- When did people start treating this as a problem?
- Was there a moment of emergence?
- What was it before it was a "problem"?
- Who first named it as such?

**Example:** "Teen mental health as crisis is recent—perhaps 2015 onwards. Before this, adolescent difficulties were often framed as 'growing pains,' 'rebellion,' or 'normal development.' The category 'mental health' itself is relatively new."

### Step 3: Trace How It Became Thinkable

What conditions made it possible to think of this as a problem?

**Questions:**
- What prior concepts were necessary?
- What institutions had to exist?
- What knowledge made this visible?
- What events triggered concern?

**Example:** "Required: widespread adoption of diagnostic categories; mental health awareness campaigns; social media providing visibility to suffering; quantification through surveys; concern about productivity loss. The 'crisis' became thinkable when adolescence became an object of psychological and economic concern."

### Step 4: Identify Who Problematizes

Who benefits from this being framed as a problem? Who speaks as authority on it?

**Questions:**
- Who gains from treating this as a problem?
- What expertise is authorized?
- What industries or interventions are enabled?
- Who controls the framing?

**Example:** "Beneficiaries: mental health professionals (more clients); tech critics (platform for critique); pharmaceutical companies (potential market); schools (justification for programs); parents (explanation for difficulties). Authorities: psychiatrists, psychologists, educators, researchers."

### Step 5: Examine What the Framing Enables

What does this problematization make possible? What interventions become thinkable?

**Questions:**
- What solutions does this framing suggest?
- What interventions are authorized?
- What practices are enabled?
- What becomes a legitimate target of concern?

**Example:** "This framing enables: mental health screening in schools; regulation of social media; therapeutic interventions; parenting programs; new apps and services; surveillance of teen behavior 'for their own good.'"

### Step 6: Examine What the Framing Forecloses

What cannot be thought within this problematization? What alternative framings are excluded?

**Questions:**
- What cannot be said within this framework?
- What alternative framings are foreclosed?
- What remains invisible?
- What solutions are unthinkable?

**Example:** "Foreclosed: that adolescent distress might be a sane response to an insane world; that 'mental health' is not neutral but produces particular subjectivities; that the economy, not the psyche, is the problem; that surveillance and intervention might worsen the situation; that earlier generations also suffered but framed it differently."

### Step 7: Disturb the Obviousness

Make strange what seemed obvious. Open space for thinking otherwise.

**Questions:**
- What if this didn't have to be a problem?
- What would change if we refused this framing?
- What other framings are imaginable?
- What becomes possible when we question the problematization?

**Example:** "If we refuse the 'teen mental health crisis' framing, we might: stop medicalizing adolescent experience; question economic and social conditions rather than individual psyches; resist new forms of surveillance; see distress as political rather than psychological; listen to teens as critics rather than patients."

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Key Principles

1. **Problems Are Made, Not Found** - Something must become a problem
2. **Problematization Has Beneficiaries** - Who gains from this framing?
3. **Every Framing Excludes** - What cannot be thought is as important as what can
4. **The Obvious Is Suspicious** - What seems self-evident requires examination
5. **Solutions Follow Problems** - The problem-framing shapes what solutions are thinkable
6. **Refuse to Solve** - The goal is not better solutions but questioning the problematization

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** Examine how "misinformation" has become a problem.

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Foucauldian Problematization: Misinformation

### The Problem-as-Given
"Misinformation" is framed as a crisis threatening democracy, public health, and social cohesion. False information spreads online, manipulating people into wrong beliefs. The solution requires fact-checking, platform moderation, and media literacy.

### Was It Always a Problem?
The term "misinformation" in its current sense is recent—emerging prominently around 2016 with concerns about "fake news" and election interference. Before this, related concerns existed (propaganda, rumors, yellow journalism), but they were not unified under "misinformation" as a technical category requiring systematic intervention.

Earlier framings: "propaganda" implied intentional manipulation by powerful actors; "censorship" was the danger, not uncontrolled speech. The shift to "misinformation" reframes the problem as uncontrolled information rather than controlled suppression.

### How It Became Thinkable
Conditions:
- **Social media:** Democratized publishing, bypassing gatekeepers
- **Quantification:** "Virality" made false claims measurable
- **Expert anxiety:** Declining trust in traditional authorities
- **Political events:** Brexit, Trump election, vaccine hesitancy
- **New disciplines:** "Misinformation research" as academic field
- **Tech platform power:** Capacity to moderate at scale

The "problem" became thinkable when information spread beyond institutional control.

### Who Problematizes
- **Traditional media:** Regain relevance as fact-checkers
- **Platforms:** Justify content moderation; present as responsible
- **Governments:** Authorize regulation of speech
- **Academics:** New research funding and relevance
- **NGOs:** New domain for intervention
- **Intelligence agencies:** Frame adversary speech as threat

What unites them: positioning as defenders of truth against the manipulated masses.

### What the Framing Enables
- Platform content moderation as public good
- Algorithmic suppression of certain claims
- "Media literacy" education
- Government-funded "counter-messaging"
- Deplatforming of voices labeled misinformation spreaders
- Partnership between government and tech (censorship-by-proxy)
- Expert authority restored as arbiter of truth

### What the Framing Forecloses
- That "misinformation" is often a label for heterodox views
- That official sources have their own record of false claims
- That disagreement is not the same as being misled
- That people may have reasons for distrust
- That the cure (centralized truth-determination) may be worse than the disease
- That "misinformation" may sometimes be true, later
- That the masses are not merely manipulated but thinking

The framing cannot ask: who decides what counts as misinformation? Why should we trust fact-checkers? What if official sources are wrong?

### Disturbing the Obviousness
If we refuse the "misinformation" framing:
- We might see a contest over who controls public discourse, not a battle of truth vs. falsehood
- We might question why institutional trust collapsed rather than why people believe "lies"
- We might resist new censorship infrastructures rather than celebrating them
- We might ask whether platform moderation is itself a form of misinformation (shaping what is thinkable)
- We might recognize that the problem of "what is true" has no neutral arbiter

The problematization of "misinformation" may itself be a power play: the restoration of gatekeeping authority under the guise of protecting truth.
